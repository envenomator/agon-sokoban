# Sokoban game for the Agon platform
![Level selector](https://github.com/envenomator/agon-sokoban/blob/master/media/levelselector.png?raw=true)

## Installation and usage
Copy both sokoban.bin and levels.bin to the microSD card, load sokoban.bin and RUN it: 
````console
LOAD sokoban.bin
RUN
````
These are seriously tricky levels, so there are also two easy/medium files available at my repo. Just rename one of them to levels.bin before running the game.
If you have an urge to create your own level from a sokoban 'compatible' textfile, compile and use the sokobanprep converter I wrote just for this purpose.
Since it's a puzzle game, there's no sound.
